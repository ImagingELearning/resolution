# Resolution, pixel size, and sampling
A tutorial to explain resolution in imaging

## The relation between pixel size, sampling, and resolution
- What is the pixel size made up of?
- What is resolution

## How to measure the pixel size
- Devices to measure the pixel size
- Method to measure the pixel size
    - Manually
    - Automated
        - the geometry math
        - Image analysis

## How to measure the resolution
- Test patterns, line pairs, Siemens star, line patterns
- Edge response
    - FWHM - fit Voigt function (approximate vs exact) https://scipython.com/book/chapter-8-scipy/examples/the-voigt-profile/ 
    - MTF - levels and what they mean
